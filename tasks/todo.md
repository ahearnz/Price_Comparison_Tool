# Price Comparison Tool - Field Analysis

## Plan
1. Analyze all Pydantic models and their fields
2. Examine database schema and field usage
3. Review frontend field dependencies
4. Identify core vs optional fields
5. Provide recommendations for field optimization

## Tasks

### ðŸ“‹ Todo Items

- [x] Identify minimal required fields for core functionality
- [x] Provide recommendations for field optimization

## âœ… Field Analysis Results

### Summary of Field Analysis

**Total Models Analyzed:** 5 Pydantic models + 1 database schema

**Field Categories Identified:**
1. **Critical Fields (8)** - Essential for core price comparison functionality
2. **Important Fields (4)** - Significantly improve user experience and functionality
3. **Enhancement Fields (7)** - Provide convenience and administrative capabilities

### Critical Fields (Cannot Remove)
- `upc` - Input parameter for all comparisons
- `APIEndpoint.name` - Required for merchant-specific response parsing
- `APIEndpoint.url` - Required for API calls
- `APIEndpoint.is_active` - Controls which APIs are queried
- `PriceResult.merchant` - Identifies result source
- `PriceResult.price` - Core comparison data
- `PriceResult.in_stock` - Affects best price calculation logic
- Response best_price/best_merchant - Primary user outputs

### Important Fields (Recommended to Keep)
- `PriceResult.error` - Error handling and user feedback
- `comparison_time` - Data freshness indicator
- Database `id` fields - Required for CRUD operations
- `APIEndpointUpdate` model - Supports partial updates

### Enhancement Fields (Could Remove for MVP)
- `created_at`/`updated_at` timestamps - Audit trail only
- `url` fields in results - Convenience links
- `headers`/`params` configuration - Advanced API setup
- `best_url` - Convenience field

### Optimization Potential
- **Current field count:** ~19 fields across all models
- **Minimal viable fields:** ~11 fields (42% reduction)
- **Recommended configuration:** ~15 fields (21% reduction)

## Review

Successfully analyzed all fields across the Price Comparison Tool application. The analysis shows that while the current field set provides comprehensive functionality, the core price comparison could operate with significantly fewer fields. The current design strikes a good balance between functionality and simplicity, with most "enhancement" fields providing meaningful value to users and administrators.
